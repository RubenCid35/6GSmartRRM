## Overview

6GSmartRRM is an AI/ML-driven project addressing the challenges of joint sub-band allocation and power control in hyper-dense 6G In-Factory subnetworks (InF-S). These subnetworks form the backbone of industrial automation systems, such as robotics, production modules, and conveyors, and face significant interference and resource management issues.

This project focuses on optimizing spectral efficiency, mitigating interference, and adapting to dynamic industrial environments using advanced AI techniques like deep learning and graph neural networks (GNNs).

## Challenge

This project is part of the ITU AI for Good Challenge, which focuses on:

    Tackling interference and resource allocation in hyper-dense industrial networks.
    Developing AI-powered solutions for dynamic and mobile environments.
    Ensuring high spectral efficiency and reliability in constrained radio frequency environments.

The project addresses the limitations of traditional radio resource management (RRM) methods and explores adaptive, scalable, and computationally efficient AI-based solutions for 6G In-Factory scenarios.

## Dataset

* **Obtain (Sub-)Optimal Target Samples**
    - The channel gains, and UE locations with respect to the BS are randomly distributed in the area to produce the channel vector for each UE. The **PSO algorithm** is used to determine the associated optimally assigned powers, which are calculated and stored in the dataset. [Source](https://disser.spbu.ru/files/2024/disser_en_sun_qiushi.pdf?page=38)

    - Use waterfilling algorithm for sub-optimal (in general conditions)
    - Use sequential iterative subband allocation (SISA) for sub-band sub-optimal allocation
    - Use graph coloring algorithm for sub-band assignment (CGC) for sub-band sub-optimal allocation.
